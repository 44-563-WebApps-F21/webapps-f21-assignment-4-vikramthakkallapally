            <h4>Title:Algernon Moncrieff’s Flat in Half-Moon Street, W</h4>
            <h5>ACT 1 DESCRIPTION</h5>
            <h6>
                Morning-room in Algernon’s flat in Half-Moon Street. The room is
                luxuriously and artistically furnished. The sound of a piano is heard
                in the adjoining room.<br>
            </h6>
            <p class="StageDirection">
              [Lane is arranging afternoon tea on the table, and after the music has
                ceased, Algernon enters.]

                <h6 class="ALGERNON">ALGERNON.</h6>
                <p class="speech">Did you hear what I was playing, Lane?</p>
                
                <h6 class="LANE">LANE.</h6>
                <p class="speech">I didn’t think it polite to listen, sir.</p>
                
                <h6 class="ALGERNON">ALGERNON.</h6>
                <p class="speech">I’m sorry for that, for your sake. I don’t play accurately—any one can
                    play accurately—but I play with wonderful expression. As far as the
                    piano is concerned, sentiment is my forte. I keep science for Life.</p>
                
                <h6 class="LANE">LANE.</h6>
                <p class="speech">Yes, sir.</p>
               
                <h6 class="ALGERNON">ALGERNON.</h6>
                <p class="speech">And, speaking of the science of Life, have you got the cucumber
                    sandwiches cut for Lady Bracknell?</p>
                
                <h6 class="LANE">LANE.</h6>
                <p class="speech">Yes, sir.</p> <p class="StageDirection">[Hands them on a salver.]</p>
                
                <h6 class="ALGERNON">ALGERNON.</h6>
                <p class="StageDirection">[Inspects them, takes two, and sits down on the sofa.]</p>
                <p class="speech">Oh! . . . by the
                    way, Lane, I see from your book that on Thursday night, when Lord
                    Shoreman and Mr. Worthing were dining with me, eight bottles of
                    champagne are entered as having been consumed.</p>
                
                <h6 class="LANE">LANE.</h6>
                <p class="speech">Yes, sir; eight bottles and a pint.</p>
                
                <h6 class="ALGERNON">ALGERNON.</h6>
                <p class="speech">Why is it that at a bachelor’s establishment the servants invariably
                    drink the champagne? I ask merely for information.</p>
                
                <h6 class="LANE">LANE.</h6>
                <p class="speech">I attribute it to the superior quality of the wine, sir. I have often
                    observed that in married households the champagne is rarely of a
                    first-rate brand.</p>
                
                <h6 class="ALGERNON">ALGERNON.</h6>
                <p class="speech">Good heavens! Is marriage so demoralising as that?</p>
